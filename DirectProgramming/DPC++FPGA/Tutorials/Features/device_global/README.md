## Purpose
This tutorial demonstrates a simple example of initializing a `device_global` to a non-zero value, and using it to keep state between multiple re-launches of a kernel.

### Description of `device_global`
The `device_global` class is an extension that introduces device scoped memory allocations into SYCL that can be accessed within a kernel using syntax similar to C++ global variables, but that have unique instances per `sycl::device`. Similar to C++ global variables, a `device_global` variable have a namespace scope and is visible to all kernels within that scope.

A `device_global` instance can be templated on a list of compile-time-constant `properties` that can enable various optimization behaviors. One such `property` is `device_image_scope` which is used in the code sample. It limits the scope of a single instance of a `device_global` to a `device_image`, further details on this property can be found [here](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/sycl/sycl/doc/extensions/proposed/sycl_ext_oneapi_device_global.asciidoc#properties-for-device-global-variables). The absence of the `device_image_scope` property is currently not supported by the compiler.

A `device_global` instance can be used to store state across multiple re-launches of a kernel without having to pass in a `buffer` as a kernel argument. An example of an application that would benefit from such a state is where kernels are nodes in a state-machine.

### Non-zero-initialization of a `device_global` - pre C++20
Without C++20 `consteval` keyword support, a `device_global` is always zero-initialized. If there is a known first usage of a `device_global` in device code, there exists a technique, described below, that allows a `device_global` to be initialized to a non-zero value. 

Using a second `device_global<bool>` representing a flag that will control when to initialize the `device_global` to a non-zero value. This flag will get zero-initialized to `false`. Once initialization happens, the flag is set to `true` and initialization code doesn't execute on subsequent relaunches of the kernel.

```cpp
using namespace sycl;
using namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental;

device_global<int> val;
device_global<bool> is_val_initialized;

int main () {
  queue Q;
  Q.submit([&](sycl::handler& h) {
    h.single_task([=] {
      // Initialization happens only once
      if (!is_val_initialized) {
        // do initialization
        is_val_initialized.get() = true;
      }

      // uses of `val`
    });
  });
}
```


### Non-zero-initialization of a `device_global`- with C++20
In a future version of this extension, it is expected that when C++20 support is available and enabled, the `consteval` keyword will be used to enable compile-time constant initialization of the device allocations backing device_global. This will simplify some coding patterns, compared with the current zero-initialization requirement.

```cpp
using namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental;

device_global<int> val {42};
```

## Key Concepts
* The basic usage of the `device_global` class
* How initialize a `device_global` to non-zero value


## Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel&reg; oneAPI toolkits using the **Generate Launch Configurations** extension.

To learn more about the extensions, see the 
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).


## Building the `device_global` Tutorial

> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: `. ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
>
>For more information on environment variables, see **Use the setvars Script** for [Linux or macOS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html), or [Windows](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).


### Include Files
The included header `dpc_common.hpp` is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Samples in Intel&reg; DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel&reg; DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel&reg; oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 12h.

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel&reg; PAC with Intel Arria&reg; 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:
    ```
    cmake ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     make report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     make fpga
     ```
3. (Optional) As the FPGA hardware compile may take several hours to complete, FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/device_global.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel&reg; PAC with Intel Arria&reg; 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```
    You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     nmake report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga
     ```

> **Note**: The Intel&reg; PAC with Intel Arria&reg; 10 GX FPGA and Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX) do not support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.

> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.

### Troubleshooting

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
``make VERBOSE=1``
For more comprehensive troubleshooting, use the Diagnostics Utility for
Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system checks to find missing
dependencies and permissions errors.
